# Mental Health Text Sorter with Tensorflow

This is a text classifier developed with the Tensorflow framework to classify texts into categories related to mental health, using the database available in Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/reihanenamdari/mental-health-corpus.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Python Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, re, Matplotlib, Sklearn, Tensorflow, NLTK, Unidecode, WordCloud and Collections

## The script will do the following:

- Loads the dataset into a DataFrame using the pandas library.
- Preprocess the data, removing punctuation and special characters, converting all words to lowercase, removing common words using the NLTK library, and normalizing words.
- Splits the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Creates a classification model using TensorFlow.
- Trains the model using the training data.
- Evaluates the model using the test data.
